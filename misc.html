    <h3>Ulysses</h3>
    <p>
      This is my cat Ulysses. He is incredibly needy and often joins me on Zoom calls. He travels really well and we regularly go on road trips around Idaho.

  <h3>Homebrew Board Games</h3>
  <p>
A few years ago I became very interested in board game design. Though I haven't brought any of my games to market yet, I love the wonderful combination of human psychology, UX design, and game theory required to build them.

   <h4>Red Regime</h4>
    <p>
  Inspired by Armando Iannucci's 'The Death of Stalin', I built Red Regime for the 2019 Board Wars 48-Hour competition. As one of the few solo competitors, I was still able to win both the People's Choice and Best Design awards.
  </p>
    <p>
  Since that time I have revised Red Regime three times and uploaded it on to Tabletop Simulator for playtesting.

 <h4>Spire</h4>
    <p>
    My first game, Spire still remains my favorite. Based on competitive tower-building, developing Spire motivated me to learn how to build and print 3D designs.
