      "When Ben Losinski and I worked together, he had his fingers on the pulse of our organization’s business needs. He saw that our company was entirely in the dark about our SLAs, and quickly and independently put together requirements for a service that would track our clients’ SLAs and whether we were meeting them. Our company recognized the value in what he had proposed, and within a few short months the project he had proposed and specced out was one of the most heavily-relied on tools used by upper management. Ben is sharp, innovative, and driven. He would be a huge asset to any organization."
